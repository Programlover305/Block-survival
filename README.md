# Block-survival
Dive into a fast-paced 2D top-down shooter where you play as a lone square trying to survive waves of relentless enemies. Armed with directional bullets and quick reflexes, you'll face off against three unique enemy types:

Standard Enemies – Slow-moving black lines that follow you with deadly precision.

Triangle Shooters – Agile enemies that move vertically and fire bullets to trap you.

Charging Rectangles – Green rectangles that stop and suddenly charge with brutal force.

Survive as long as possible while racking up your score by defeating enemies. Each enemy drops in at increasing intervals to keep you on your toes. Health management and movement are key — one wrong step could be your last!

Can you survive the chaos?
